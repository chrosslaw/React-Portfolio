This page will hopefully display my creativity and some of the skills Iâ€™ve learned during college. I started programming around four years ago and can  not get enough and am open to freelance work or even new career opportunities. My preferred languages are Python, Javascript, and C#, and my career goals are aimed at software development or web development.
